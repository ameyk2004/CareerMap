## 📌 Introduction
I am from **PICT Pune**, and in **September 2024**, I had the opportunity to interview for a **Summer Internship** at **Barclays, Pune**. The process was challenging yet exciting. Here's a detailed breakdown of my experience! 🚀

*Resources at the end*

---

## 📝 Direct Interview
I got in through **Barclays Hack-o-Hire 2024** [🔗 LINK](https://www.hackerearth.com/challenges/hackathon/hack-o-hire/), their yearly hackathon for **second-year and third-year students**. My team and I ranked **in the top 25 among 1250+ teams**, which resulted in us getting a **direct interview** without an **online assessment (OA)**.

This was a great advantage as I didn't have to compete with **hundreds of candidates** for an interview via OA. I received an **early confirmation (2 months prior)** that I would get a direct interview, giving me a **head start** to solely focus on **interview preparation**. 🎯

## 🏆 Round 1: Technical Interview

- **Mode:** Offline
- **Duration:** ~20 mins
- **Interviewer:** **VP @ Barclays** [🔗 Mr. Pradeep Tripathi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pradeep-tripathi-12444a42/)

I was prepared to talk extensively about my **projects**, experience at **Hack-o-Hire**, and core CS subjects (**OOP, DSA, DBMS, OS, CNS**), along with **LeetCode-style questions** if needed. However, since it was **early in the day** and due to **Mr. Pradeep’s friendly nature**, the interview felt more like a **tech enthusiast café conversation** than a formal interview. No **DSA or SQL** questions were asked, which is fairly uncommon for tech interviews.

For **20 minutes**, we only discussed **emerging tech**, **interesting technical details**, and my **interest in Barclays**. I didn’t perceive the talking points as **questions**—it felt like a **nuanced discussion** instead. ✨

### 📌 Talking Points:

1. **Our Educational Backgrounds 🎓**
   - I started the interview by greeting him by **his first name**, which is part of **Barclays’ culture** (""Sir"" is highly discouraged). I had noted his name during the **pre-placement talk** that morning, which **earned me instant brownie points**. I had also checked his **LinkedIn profile** for additional talking points.
   - After introducing myself and summarizing my **last two years at PICT Pune**, I directly asked him about **his education**, which he was very interested in discussing.

2. **My Experience at Hack-o-Hire 🚀**
   - Since I had thought extensively about this beforehand, I provided a **genuine perspective** rather than blind praise. This **elevated my human element** in the conversation.
   - He then asked, **""Would you like to join Barclays?""**—within just **5 minutes**! This made me feel like **I couldn’t fail**, even if I deliberately tried. Everything after this was **just talking**.

3. **My Projects and His Projects 🔍**
   - I discussed my **projects**, and after some **elementary questioning**, I flipped the conversation by asking about **his career projects**.
   - Since I had **researched** his **LinkedIn** and knew about his **documented projects**, I was able to engage in an insightful discussion.

4. **AI and Modern Software Development 🤖**
   - We discussed how **AI is transforming software engineering**.
   - He had started with **IBM mainframes** and **limited internet access**, whereas I code using **LLMs without lifting a finger**—a generational shift we both found fascinating.

5. **Finding the Maximum Integer in a List 🔢**
   - He gave me this **super simple** coding question, possibly just to **keep the interview formal**. We both knew that technical interviews are **about coding**, so he **lowballed** the question.

✅ **Cleared this round and moved to the final interview!** 🚀

---

## 🔥 Round 2: HR + Core Tech 👾

- **Mode:** offline
- **Duration:** ~1 Hr 30 mins
- **Interviewer:** **VP @ Barclays Mr. Shashank**

### 📌 Discussion Points:

- **Introduction & Hometown 🌍**
  - This turned into an **extended discussion** about both of our hometowns.

- **Project Discussion 💻**
  - Whatever you **mention in your resume** is your **question sheet**—nothing outside of it will be asked.
  - My **Kafka experience** was tested with tricky questions about **producers, consumers**, and **consumer groups**.
  - I was also asked to **draw a data pipeline** involving **Kafka and load balancers** (it’s a blur now ).

- **Java 🏗️**
  - Barclays is a **major Java shop**, so Java knowledge is highly valued.
  - My interview revolved around **OOP concepts** and **low-level system design** (essentially, designing classes and structuring them using OOP).

- **Behavioral Questions 🤝**
  - I was given **zero-sum game scenarios**, where there was no clear solution benefiting both parties.
  - The goal wasn’t to **solve the problem**, but to **explain my approach** using **corporate thinking**.
  - Some questions included:
    - *A time when I worked in a team and resolved a conflict.*
    - *A situation where I couldn't get things my way—how did I handle it?*
  - These questions are designed to **simulate stressful situations**, so it’s important to **stay calm and composed**. 

✅ **This was a smooth discussion**, mainly assessing my **core tech skills, communication, confidence, and cultural fit**.

I am from PICT Pune, and in late August 2024, I had the opportunity to interview for a Summer Internship for BNY. It was the first company that had arrived for 3rd year summer internships, and it was definitely worth the hype. The process was challenging, confusing, and invigorating. Here's a detailed breakdown of my experience! 😍

---

### 1. 🏢 **Company & Role**

*   **Company:** Bank of New York
*   **Role:** SDE Intern
*   **Batch/Year of Graduation:** 2026
*   **Branch:** IT

---

### 2. 📅 **Application Process**

*   **How did you apply?** On-Campus
*   **Timeline:**
    *   **Application Date:** within ~1 week before test
    *   **Online Assessment Date:** 24th August, 2024
    *   **Interview Dates:** 26th August (2 interviews)
    *   **Offer Date:** upcoming (🤞)

---

### 3. 💬 **Interview Rounds**

#### Round 1:Online Assessment
*   **Type:** Coding
*   **Description:** The round consisted of 4 questions, 2 easy/medium and 2 hard. The questions were mostly DSA based, but easier questions did not require much DSA knowledge, mostly basic math, stacks, etc. The hard questions used graph, DP, trees, and some advanced data structures like segment trees. The questions were selected from question bank (2 from easy category and 2 from hard). I don't remeber the exact questions but the concepts used were as follows. 
    *   **Example Questions:**
        1.  A simple mod exponentiation problem. We had to calculate 2^n mod 1e9+7. However, the question was garbed as a graph question, something along the lines of 'find all possible graphs with nodes numbered 1 to n'. Elemntary knowledge of graph was needed to simplify it to mod exponentiation. 🤩
        2.  Purely implementation problem. AFAIR, it required no special data strucutre, or logic, just arrays, knowledge of a programming language (Python, C++, Java, or Assembly, if that's what you know). In difficulty I would say it fell at 900-1000 level on CF rating. ☺️
        3.  I don't have a clue of what this question was. But it was almost just as hard as next, if not more. I chose to skip this so I could focus on the next one. 🫥
        4. I got a question of DP on strings. Atleast, that's what I felt. Majority of my time went here. I (again) don't remember the problem. I was unable to pass all the test cases despite spending ~1hr+ here. 🥲

*   **Difficulty Level:** a. and b. easy, c. and d. hard
*   **Your Experience:** There were people who had soved all 4, and many who had solved 3. Even among those who had solved just 2, they had passed more cumulative test cases on the 2 hard questions than me. But who got selected? Seemingly random people. I think the company chose to focus not just on no. of test cases passed but also the approach to each problem, and code quality. Most other companies don't do this, and I have no idea how BNY did this (since there were 100s of students), so I can't be sure. Maybe they chose a hidden criteria, but I don't have conclusive evidence for anything.

#### Round 2: Online Technical Interview
*   **Type:** Technical
*   **Description:** Round divided into 2 major rounds. In first part, 3 quick fire questions were asked. In second part, 3 coding questions were asked, and we hade to type out the code for them during the meet in a shared code editor, in our preferred language.
*   **Example Questions:**
     *   1.  Quick fire questions. For example, what is time and space complexity of hash map? It wasn't very hard, and focusing on college DSA would be enough in most cases. 3 of these questions and it took barely 2 - 3 minutes. 🔍
     *   2.  Coding test. **First** was very easy, it was something along the lines of mapping items and stores, and finding some information about them. I used arrays, hashmaps to solve it. **Second** was easy too but tough to understand. It was something like: I have 2 cars, and these cars are starting from different locations towards same final destination, and their paths meet somewhere in the middle. There were several stations along the route of both cars, with some (or no) people on every station. A person would board the car that arrives at his station first. We had to tell, in the end, which car would have which persons. The interview time was over before I could get the 3rd question.💡
*   **Difficulty Level:** Easy to easy-medium
*   **Your Experience:** If you, a person who has basic grasp on dsa/cp, encountered these problems in wild, you would have probably spat on them and moved on. The difficulty was not in the question itself, but rather doing it with an interviewer staring at you and you having to explain every step of your thinking process. The interview was cut short due to time because it is tough to explain everything AND code accurately, handling edge cases and logic. I slipped a little on edge cases and therefore took way longer on 2nd coding question that I would like to admit. Other than that, the interview was okayish.
* 
* #### Round 3: Interview
*  **I will update this soon, thanks for the patience!!**

## 🎉 Final Outcome: Selected! 

In conclusion, my on-campus interview experience with BNY was both challenging and rewarding. The process tested my technical knowledge, problem-solving skills, and ability to communicate effectively under pressure. Engaging with the interviewers and learning about the company’s culture gave me valuable insights into the industry. Regardless of the outcome, the experience was a great learning opportunity that will help shape my future career.",https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJi0BC1sGV8QlCf_bHYP8akHhUfvLWIaRp_1L0TdSby8Z09GGfx=s96-c,

**Round 1 - Online Assesment**

Few Technical mcqs based on CNS,OS and DBMS, 1 SQL query and 1 Medium to Hard coding question.

**Round 2 - Tech Interview**

It was different for everyone since it was based on panelists, 
My tech Round comprised of a lot of DBMS, DSA(simple questions on linkedlist and trees), real life application of OOPS and a lot of majorly on my project.

My interview was for around 1 hour 20 mins ish, My interviewer asked me first question after screening through my resume that was a real life application question based one of my project where he had told me write a code in CPP for onboarding users on a platform and storing the data in a data structure of linked list and storing the data in metadata and finally saving individual user data in a file structure, which requried me to write file handling code in CPP. This section was very time consuming and he was mostly testing if I was able to think of all edge cases in the flow and write appropriate code.

Later there were questions on DSA(trees, linkedlist), DBMS, mostly about Normalisation, Transactions and Concurrency etc etc.

This round depends a lot on panelist, my interviewer was a more keen on DBMS, so although Barclays is very focused on Java background, my interviewer didnot grill me on Java and CPP (which was in my resume) so it worked for me. Other panelists weren't same, they were asking Java and OOPS in Java releated questions a lot even if you don't have Java in your resume.

**Round 3 - Tech + HR**

In the last round around 23 students were selected. My Interview was fully based on my resume. I had a good discussion about my projects then web dev based questions on react typescript, node etc, a few situational questions and questions about my hackathons.

Finally All the 23 students qualified for the last round got the offers for full time.

Hey Folks,

I’m Piyush from PICT, Pune, and today, I’m excited to share my incredible interview experience with Barclays. Buckle up, because this journey was nothing short of thrilling! 🚀


---
###  The Hackathon That Started It All

It all began on April 7, 2024. A total of 25 teams, each with four members, from six different colleges across India, were invited to Barclays’ Pune office for a 36-hour hackathon.

With a grand inauguration ceremony, the hackathon kicked off. We were eager to brainstorm and code solutions for the given problem statement. Our mentors were extremely supportive, guiding us through our initial approach. Their insights boosted our confidence and reassured us that we were on the right track. 

After 36 hours of relentless coding, the results were announced—we made it to the top 8 finalists! But there was another challenge ahead. We had to present our solution to the CEO of Barclays India and other senior leaders. Unfortunately, we didn’t make it past this round.

[Our Project.](https://github.com/piyush960/FinWatch.git)

However, on June 14, we received an unexpected notice—we were selected for direct interviews! 🎉


---


### The Preparation Dilemma

Did I immediately start preparing? Not really. Instead, I focused on improving my overall skills rather than solely relying on this opportunity. I also secured a three-month internship, which turned out to be a game-changer in my interview preparation.

Fast forward to September 7, we got the notification—Barclays was visiting our campus for Summer Intern roles. This was my cue to start focused preparation. But where to begin? I was overwhelmed.

After reading multiple interview experiences, I concluded that Barclays primarily looks for Java, SQL, and strong DBMS knowledge. My previous internship helped me structure my resume strategically to highlight my SQL skills. Here’s how I planned my study:

**Day 1**: Operating Systems and basic DSA

**Day 2**: DBMS and SQL

**Day 3**: Just rest! No more cramming.

**The Big Day - September 10**

The day started with a pre-placement talk (PPT). I carefully noted the company’s key values. The interviews began at 11 AM, I knew who my interviewer was (thanks to the PPT), so I quickly checked her LinkedIn profile before heading in.



---


### Round 1: Technical Interview

**Q1: Introduce yourself.**

I had prepared this well, including my degree, academic achievements (FE topper!), hackathons, previous internship experience, and my preferred tech stack. I deliberately avoided mentioning Java since I wasn’t confident in its core concepts.

**Q2: Why did you choose this tech stack for your projects?**

**Q3: Why SQL?**

My strategy worked! She focused on SQL, allowing me to steer the interview in my comfort zone.

**Q4: Write a SQL query to find all employees with the second-highest salary.**

A generic question. I had prepared five different solutions, starting from the most complex to the easiest one.

**Q5: DBMS-related questions.**

**Q6: Why not MongoDB? Some follow-up questions on NoSQL.**

Now, it was my turn to ask questions. From her LinkedIn, I saw she was an AWS Solution Architect and Scrum Master, so I asked about her role in AWS. She was impressed!

---


### Round 2: HR + Technical Interview

I barely had time to relax before being called in for the next round within five minutes.

**Q1: Another introduction, followed by a discussion about my projects.**

**Q2: “What’s Pulsiefy?”**

One of my projects—a symptom-based hospital finder web app. I had a strong answer prepared since this was a real-life problem I personally faced.

**Q3: More SQL!**

Given source and destination cities, find all connecting flights from City A to City B.

I couldn’t fully solve it but explained my thought process. It was partially correct, and the interviewer was okay with it.

**Q4: My internship experience and how I solved a particular problem. He was impressed.**

This was an HR interview, so I framed my question around Barclays’ core values (RISES) with a mix of technical curiosity. He liked it and gave a detailed response, extending the interview by 10 extra minutes!



---


### The Wait & The Result

I submitted my resume, chatted with friends, grabbed some much-needed snacks, and waited. And waited. After eight long hours, the results were announced.

And guess what? I got selected! 🎉


---


### Final Thoughts & Key Takeaways

- Stay calm. Don’t rush your answers.
- Structure your resume strategically.
- Don’t include unnecessary details. (I mentioned ChatGPT, which slightly backfired in Round 1.)
- Be prepared, but also flexible during interviews.
- Most importantly, enjoy the process!

Barclays has an amazing culture. We clicked pictures, celebrated, and ended the day on a high note. A truly unforgettable experience!

### 3. 💬 **Interview Rounds**

#### Round 1: [Online Assessment]
* Half the weightage was given to 2 coding questions at the end, which were both pretty easy, if you know even basic programming.
* The other half was given to MCQs, mostly logical reasoning and mathematical questions, a few about C++ or OOPS (though i dont remember much at this point)



#### Round 2: [Technical Interview]
* Most students underwent 2 techincal interviews, but only one was conducted for me. I eventually learnt that there was a vast difference in the candidates' technical interview experience, because it was conducted by their future teams. Maybe they scout candidates for particular roles only, based on their resumes.
Some people were asked about OOPS and fundamentals. My interview involved system design.
* We discussed a project of mine - a social media website exclusive to PICT students. I explained my tech-stack decisions, we delved into how i would scale the system. Talked about security, rate limiters, drawbacks of using rate limiters at various levels in a multi-server system, etc. i avoided the topic of cache invalidation, and confessed that i did not know much about system design, but the interviewer was happy with my knowledge.
* DSA question - sort an array of 0s and 1s. 

#### Round 3 [HR]:

*   Gave a simple puzzle. Asked a couple of classic HR questions -
1. How do you stay updated on current trends?
2. Tell me about a time when you had to resolve a dispute within your group?

* I forget the rest of the questions, but they were similar to the ones above.

srushti-sonavanes-experience-at-barclays-intern-2022-8TU7xO,Srushti Sonavane,srushtisonavane@gmail.com,Intern,Barclays,CS,2022,"In the second week of October 2022, Barclays came to my college for the position of Software Intern (Summer Internship). The recruitment process at Barclays typically consists of two rounds: Round 1, which is an online test, and Round 2, which is an interview.

Round 1: The Online Test

We had a two-hour window to complete the test, with 45 minutes allocated for the actual test. The test was divided into two parts: the first part consisted of multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and the second part was a coding test. The MCQ round included 30 questions covering various topics such as

    Python
    C++
    Java
    SQL
    MongoDB
    Database Queries
    OOP
    Computer Networks and Security

The second part of the test was the coding section, which had 2 questions of easy to medium difficulty level unless you were unfortunate enough to receive questions on Graphs and Dynamic Programming (like some of my friends did!). In my case, the coding questions focused on string manipulation (strangely, I always seem to come across at least one question on this topic) and an array-based question. The test was conducted on the HackerEarth platform.

After completing the test, it took 2–3 days to receive the list of shortlisted students, and a total of 80 students from our college made it to the next round.

Round 2: The Interview Round

I had my interview on October 19, 2022, conducted online through Microsoft Teams, which lasted for approximately 30 minutes. One of the best things about Barclays is that they inform you about your panelist via email, allowing you to check their profile and prepare accordingly. In most cases, the panelist tends to be one of the company’s Vice Presidents (VPs) with extensive experience.

My interviewer had a significant background in IT and possessed expertise in Software Project Management (Agile and Waterfall methodologies), Java, Spring Framework, SQL, Android, and various other areas. In addition to studying the core subjects like OOP, DSA, DBMS, and CNS, I also focused on these topics.

The interview began with a brief introduction about myself. Surprisingly, my interviewer did not ask me about my resume and immediately delved into the question portion. Here are the questions I was asked:

  ` Explain various data types along with examples.
    Discuss various data structures and their applications.
    Elaborate on the pillars of OOP with real life examples.
    Share my preferred programming languages (for which I chose Python) and then code on a notepad. I was asked to calculate the number of occurrences of a word in a paragraph (ignoring letter case) and modify the code to count the occurrences of each letter (another string manipulation problem!).
    Implement any pillar of OOP in any language I felt comfortable with (I opted for C++ this time).
    Answer two SQL queries, one of medium difficulty and another slightly tricky.
    Next, he asked me to mention one of my favorite subjects, to which I responded with TOC (Theory of Computation). I assumed that he wouldn’t inquire further about it, but to my surprise, he proceeded to ask about the topics covered in that subject and followed it up with 2 questions related to regular expressions.`

As I had mentioned my interest in the field of AI and ML during my introduction, the interviewer then posed two questions related to it. Firstly, he inquired about my motivation for choosing AI/ML as a field and what aspects of it fascinate me. Secondly, he mentioned an article featuring Sophia, a robot, suggesting that robots might surpass humans based on an interview she was part of. I was then asked to share my opinion on this matter, which caught me off guard.

Finally, I was given the opportunity to ask any questions I had for the interviewer, and I had prepared two questions in advance, as this is always a must-ask question.

The interview concluded precisely after 30 minutes. Although I stumbled on one question I was happy with my overall performance and, it was truly a great experience!

The result of the interview was announced after a week or so, and I was elated to discover the news of my selection :)

Here are some tips I found helpful during my preparation:

1. Practice DSA questions on platforms like GeeksforGeeks and LeetCode.
2. Develop a strong foundation in CS fundamentals, including OOP, DSA, DBMS, CNS, and OS. I recommend using InterviewBit and GeeksforGeeks for quick revision.
3. Be well-versed with your resume and projects as well so that you can confidently discuss them if the interview goes in that direction.
4. Seek insights from seniors who have been placed or have completed internships at the specific company you are interviewing with. Their experiences does provide valuable guidance.
5. Do thorough research about the company. This knowledge will come in handy during the interview.
6. Explore the GeeksforGeeks archive for resources related to the company you are interviewing with.
7. Remember that interviewers are usually friendly toward candidates, so be confident in your answers. Expressing your knowledge is just as important as knowing it.
8. For Barclays, it’s beneficial to read about their RISES values, even though I wasn’t asked about it but its something which they generally ask in their interview. You can find this information on their website.
9. Prepare a thoughtful and relevant question to ask the interviewer at the end of the interview. It demonstrates your interest in the company.
10. Be well prepared with the “tell me about yourself” question as the first impression really does matters.

One of the most crucial tips is to have patience and be consistent. Prior to my experience with Barclays, I faced consecutive rejections in the initial rounds of 4–5 companies. Despite these setbacks, I maintained confidence in myself. It’s important to believe in your abilities. Internship and placement drives can be overwhelming for students, but stay focused on your preparation and give it your utmost effort. With determination, you will undoubtedly secure a position at your dream company. Wishing you all the best!",https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKLq2-ajKPaOivevlvtPU_rb0OvwVlA8rk9UTPAQFXrQkX0_msb=s96-c,

    *   **Offer Date:** 10th October 2024

---

### 3. 💬 **Take Home Challenge**

*   **Description:** The challenege was to build a scalable web application that generates personalized travel itineraries based on user preferences, such as budget, interests, and trip duration. Functionally, an ideal solution should offer a user-friendly interface for inputting preferences and deliver detailed, dynamic itineraries tailored to individual users.
*   **Difficulty Level:** Medium - Hard
*   **Your Experience:** It was a interesting problem to solve and the team really liked my submission. I approached the problem in the following way:

       1. First, I understood the problem statement and then started with the architecture or design of what my application should look like. 

    1. I listed down the functional and non-functional requirements for the app and decided the tech stack I will be using to build this app.

    1. I first built the backend for it in **Node.js** following the **Object oriented programming** principles and for database I chose to use **MongoDB** as it is best suited to store the generated itineraries in a flexible format.

    1. For frontend, I utilized **Next.js** and **Magic UI** to create a user friendly application.

    1. Leveraged **Gemini’s API** for its **AI Model** allows for personalized itinerary generation based on user preferences. The AI can analyze user data, past behavior, and real-time information to create tailored itineraries that match individual interests, such as destination, trip duration, and budget, thus enhancing the travel experience.

    1. Integrated **Google Maps API** to visualize locations, such as hotels and places suggested by Gemini's API, adds a practical layer to the application. It improves the usability of the itineraries by providing users with interactive maps and directions, directly enhancing the travel planning experience.

    1. Used **Redis** for In-memory Caching and Rate Limiting APIs, **Docker** to containerize the application and additionally implemented **CI/CD** pipelines for integrations.

### 4. 💬 **Technical Interview Round**

#### Round 1: Technical Interview
*   **Type:** Technical
*   **Description:** This interview was an hour deep dive techincal interview. It started with the interviewer giving a brief introduction about himself, his role etc. Then I introduced myself and we began with the interview.

     1. The first question he asked me was DSA question which was I would say Leetcode Easy - Medium. I can't exactly recall the question but it was related to arrays and binary search on answers. I was able to solve it with first 7 - 10 mins.

    1.  Then he went on to ask a question related to SQL. The question was to fetch top 5 most recent entries from a table. And I took a minute to understand the problem and immediately wrote the SQL query for it. 

    1.  Then I was asked a few questions on Node.js, React.js and in general Javascript. I was also asked about the difference between a SQL and NoSQL database and their usecases.

    1. Next up, I was asked to design a high level architecture of a checkout system for a E-commerce application.

    1.  And in the end we discussed my **Take home challenge** submission. The system's scalability, trade offs, how can this app be made more scalable etc.

*   **Difficulty Level:** Medium - Hard
*   **Your Experience:** It was a pretty great experience. The interviewer was nice, friendly and I gave all the answers promptly.

* ### 5. 💬 **Culture Fit Round**

* #### Round 1: Culture Fit Round
*   **Type:** HR
*   **Description:** This was a culture fit round. At Atlan, it is very important for a candidate to be culture fit. The candidate must be tuned to the values of Atlan. So you can say that it is one of the most crucial rounds and most of the candidates are rejected in this round.
* The interview started with a brief introduction of the interviewer. Moving on, I introduced myself and then he asked me about my background, where was I born, my schooling, my personal and professional background. 
* Then Next up, he gave me certain scenarios and asked me what would you do, if you were apart of so and so team, how would you handle this particular situation etc.
* Later we discussed about the company, I had a few doubts regarding remote working culture of Atlan and he was happy to answer all of my doubts. And with that the interview ended.
*   **Difficulty Level:** Easy - Medium

Hello everyone! I am here to share my experience of the whole process. 
### 1. 🏢 **Company & Role**

*   **Company:** Siemens
*   **Role:** Intern
*   **Batch/Year of Graduation:** 2026
*   **Branch:** Computer Engineering

---

### 2. 📅 **Application Process**

*   **How did you apply?** On-Campus
*   **Timeline:**
    *   **Application Date:** 10-01-2025

---

### 3. 💬 **OA and Interview Rounds**

#### Round 1: Online Assessment
*   **Type:** MCQ
*   **Description:** Aptitude, programming skills, DSA, OOP, DBMS concepts
*   **Tips:**

1. Practice aptitude questions.
2. Solve dsa problems daily.
3. Read instructions carefully in the beginning of the test, divide time accordingly and keep checking the timer.

#### Round 2: Technical Interview
*   **Type:** Technical
*   **Description:** OOP concepts are asked, explain them with examples, programming skills, solve dsa problems, solve puzzles, have a proper discussion on the projects mentioned in your resume
*   **Tips:**

1. Must have strong understanding in subjects like **OOP, DSA, DBMS, CNS, OS, etc. Keep revising and practing them** so that you don't get confused in the interview. You should be able to give proper examples and your explaination should be satisfactory.
2. **Don't waste your interviewers' time**: Whenever you feel stuck, try for some more time and even after doing so, if you dont come up with a solution, please accept that you need to revise on that topic. Assure that you will go through it after the interview. This is important because this shows your humble attitude (slightly), acceptance and interest in improvement.
3. **Avoid silence for a long period of time**: Try to keep the session interactive especially when the interviewers' ask you to solve questions (dsa, puzzles) or ask you to write pseudocode. Explain your approach, while solving it / writing it, instead of writing it at once and then explaining it in one go. It will ensure that they are engaged and even if you get stuck in between then atleast it will leave mark that you tried.
4. **Different approaches**: When you are given a question to solve, you may either come up with single or multiple solutions. 

- In case of **single solution**, explain your approach, draw it on paper for better visualization, after which the interviewers might ask you to optiomize it. They might even give you a hint, think more on how to do so because when they give us a hint, then it is expected that we solve it in more optimal way. Think for a while, explain while writing and keep it interactive and so on as explained above.

- In case of **multiple solutions** however, start with brute force, then keep on optimising it and before moving on towards next approach ask them if they want you to explain the better one.
5. **Listen to the interviewers patiently** and avoid making a mistake in hearing or understanding their question.
6. **Explain projects** mentioned in your resume and your contribution in it.

#### Round 3 : HR Interview Round

*   Prepare your introduction, have discussion on extra curricular activites, participation in college events, clubs, hackathons, achievements. Be on time, know your challenges and how you plan to overcome them. Also, this round a mizture of tech and not tech questions so re-read your resume twice or thrice. Have some questions to ask them.

---
Verdict : Selected
---
The selection processes are really meant for people with high patience, the ones who keep trying, find areas on improvement and keep on working on that, so be one of those. You will find that people with opporunities have faced challenges before and they have kept on making theirselves even more capable of deserving the opportunity.

I am grateful to be able to help the readers and I hope that I was able to.

anish-manwar-experience-at-phonepe-sde-2023-ppssss,Anish Manwar,anishmanwar24@gmail.com,SDE,PhonePe,CS,2023,"# 📌 My PhonePe Interview Experience

## Introduction
I’m an undergrad studying in my **fourth year of engineering in Computer Engineering** at **Pune Institute of Computer Technology**. As per every year, **PhonePe** visited our college with the golden opportunity of a **full-time SDE Role** at their prestigious organization. The drive was open to all **BE students** as long as they fulfilled the criteria for dream companies set by our college **TnP Cell**. Gritting my teeth, I went into what was a test of **sheer resolve and skills**.

## 📢 PPT (Pre-Placement Talk)
We had a **Pre-Placement Talk** open to all students where they thoroughly discussed the **company policies, values, use cases, tech stack, compensation, etc.**
I jotted down a few notes from the **PPT** for discussions in later interview rounds, especially the **HR round**. (**Bitter foreshadowing**)

## Round 1: Online Assessment
- The **Online Assessment** was held on **DoSelect Platform** early in the morning at **9 AM**.
- The test had **4 questions** and **90 minutes** to solve all of them with a score of **100 per question**.

### Problems:
1. **In an office of N lanes with desks of only prime lengths**, each team is supposed to sit in one lane. The length of the *ith* lane and the cost of laying one desk in the *ith* lane are represented by **2 arrays**. Find the **minimum total cost** to complete desking of all **N lanes**. *(Easily solvable with SPF and modular arithmetic.)*

2. **Rearrange an array of positive integers** to maximize the sum of **GCDs of adjacent elements** in the array. *(I managed to pass half the cases with next_permutation. The most optimal approach probably lies in bitmask DP.)*

3. **Maximize the members in a team** where the *ith* member will only join if **ai** members have strictly greater power than him and **bi** members have power less than him. *(I couldn’t solve this one; it's likely solvable with binary search on answer.)*

4. **Find the total number of ways** to execute all functions given that they can only be executed if a given function before them was previously executed. *(Didn’t get time to look into it much so can’t say.)*

I solved the **1st problem completely** and the **2nd one partially**.
**11 people** were shortlisted, including me, from the coding rounds for further evaluation.

## First Technical Interview Round
It was an **offline interview** which roughly lasted for **an hour**. The mode of the interview was **pen and paper**. The interviewer was rather **zealous and obliging**. It seemed as if he had **tons of experience** under his belt. He attempted to put me in **vulnerable situations** in even the **easiest problems** a lot.

He started by asking about **myself** a bit. Then, he asked if I had worked on a **project in any database**, to which I **agreed** and told him about one in **PHP and SQL**. We then discussed my project during my **summer internship** and my **overall experience** regarding the same.

He later insisted on continuing the interview with **Problem Solving / Data Structures questions**, to which I willingly agreed.

### Questions:
1. **Merge Two Sorted Arrays**
   - Given **two sorted arrays of integers**, merge them into a single sorted array. *(Easily done with two pointers.)*
   - Then he **scaled the problem to 10 arrays**. I suggested using a **hashmap, 10 pointers, priority queue, or a binary search tree**.
   - **Note:** He bugged me a lot with even the **smallest and unorthodox corner cases** not being included in my pseudocode. So always **start with requirement gathering and look out for corner cases** when approaching interview questions.

2. **Find the Pair with Maximum Product**
   - Given an **array of integers**, find the **pair with maximum product**. *(Easily solvable with 4 pointers.)*

He discussed a lot over the **complexities** of these approaches and if it is possible to **improve them further**, even over **average cases**.
Then, he asked if I had any questions for him, to which I responded by **asking a few regarding use cases of Contact Graphs in PhonePe**.

**6 people**, including me, made it to the **second round**.

## Second Technical Interview Round
It was an **offline interview** which roughly lasted for **45 minutes**. The mode of the interview was **pen and paper**. The interviewer was a bit **timid but knew a lot about problem-solving and competitive programming**.

He started by **asking me which direction** I wanted the interview to go (*either coding or development*), to which I responded with **coding**.

Then, he asked me about my **favorite data structure**.
**MY FIRST MISTAKE!** I responded with **graphs**, hoping for an extra impression. He asked me stuff about **Disjoint Set Union** and its complexities. I did manage to answer but **it shook my confidence and resolve** a lot in the end.

### Questions:
1. **Number of Ways to Cut a Land**
   - Given **a land with N x M plots**, there are **T known treasures** buried in some of them. You have **K sons**.
   - In one operation, you can either **cut the land vertically** and give all plots to the **left** of the cut to one of your sons or **cut the land horizontally** and give all plots **above** the cut to one of your sons.
   - **Basically this:**
     [Leetcode Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-ways-of-cutting-a-pizza/)
   - **MY SECOND MISTAKE!** I **perceived the problem to be harder** than it ever was. I couldn’t answer further.

2. **Painters Painting a Roof**
   - **Alice and Bob** are two painters painting a **roof of N x M cells**.
   - Alice paints the roof **horizontally** in **A1, A2, ..., AN** and Bob paints it **vertically** in **B1, B2, ..., BM**.
   - **To find the bad cell count:** I answered with a **solution in binary search** with **O(N log M) Complexity**.

3. **Array Splitting Problem**
   - Literally this problem but **without the circular arrangement part**.
   - I answered with an **O(N) solution** by **sorting and splitting the array**.

**4 people** were selected from this round.
**Unfortunately, I got rejected.**

## 🎯 Conclusion
I got **rejected**, but the experience felt **worth the hassle**.
Thanks to **Competitive Programming**, I made it as far as I could.
The **drive was great overall**, my **skills, luck, and resolve weren’t enough**, and the **best candidates got their well-deserved roles**.",https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/3665/3665909.png,

soham-deshpandes-experience-at-barclays-sde-2026-AlNHhT,Soham Deshpande,doyalkudo@gmail.com,SDE,Barclays,CS,2026,"## 🎯 Barclays Hack-o-Hire 2024 Interview Experience  

### Barclays Recruitment Process 📌  
Barclays visits campus almost every year and follows a **standard recruitment process**, including:  
- **DSA Rounds**  
- **CV Screening**  
- **Technical and HR Interviews**  

However, I participated in **[Barclays Hack-o-Hire 2024](https://www.hackerearth.com/challenges/hackathon/hack-o-hire/)** during my second year. My team worked on a **customer support app** capable of:  
- Tracking customer queries across different communication platforms  
- Summarizing queries  
- Attempting preliminary resolution via chatbots  

Due to this, I directly advanced to the **interview process**, skipping the online assessment. However, **DSA is still crucial** regardless of the route taken.  

---

### The Day of the Interview ☀️  
We were called early in the morning, but the actual process started around **10 AM** due to logistics.  

Sitting in a chair, nervously waiting for my turn, I was fortunate to be comforted by **[Apeksha Bhosale](https://www.linkedin.com/in/apeksha-bhosale-9676b8203/)** didi (which means ""older sister"" in Indian languages). She helped me **rationalize my thoughts and stay calm**.  

A short conversation with **[Anand Jahangirdar](https://www.linkedin.com/today/author/anand-jahagirdar-908347a0)** sir further **boosted my confidence**. His friendly and respectful demeanor made me believe the process would be **fair and encouraging**—and surprisingly, that was the case.  

---

### Technical Interview ⚙️  
The technical round **went well**. Maybe my **Hack-o-Hire participation gave me an edge**, but by this point, my **confidence had grown significantly**.  

With many TE and BE candidates, the process was taking time. But as we exchanged **technical interview experiences**, my **hope kept increasing**.  

---

### HR Interview 🏛️  
My HR interview was conducted by **[Khushboo Dubey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/khushboo-dubey-61915434/)** ma’am.  

We discussed various topics, including **Marcus Aurelius** and other philosophical subjects, before arriving at a crucial question:  

> _""If urgent changes are needed and you are unavailable, would you share your credentials with a colleague or supervisor?""_  

I **naïvely answered**:  
> _""Only if I trust the person.""_  

This **failed the Integrity principle** of **Barclays' RISES values**, which **Khushboo ma’am politely pointed out**.  

At that moment, I thought I was **done for**.  

However, I **calmly explained my thought process** and added:  
> _""Perhaps I am naïve.""_  

(This is still true, by the way.)  

Maybe sticking to my honest reasoning helped because...  

---

### The Final Selection 🎉  
By **7 PM**, I was nervously waiting in the hallway. As my friends were called into the seminar hall one by one, **hearing my name was the sweetest feeling**.  

Inside, **Anand sir** suddenly announced:  
> _""There will be a third round now.""_  

Immediately, **everyone was on alert**. But the Know it all **[Nilay Tayade](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nilay-tayade/)** pointed out:  
> _""They do this every year. Just a stress reliever. No extra round.""_  

And Fortunatley he was right

The most **relieved I had felt in a long time** was when Anand sir revealed he was just **messing with us**—we had **been selected at Barclays!** 🎉  

The room erupted in **cheers and excitement**. Seniors (BEs) shared their own experiences about **the long journey to getting Finally selected** as they went from company to company and the **relief they felt** when that finally happened.  And that is an eye opener to what all this really meant.

---

## 🌟 My Two Cents  
💡 **Do your research before the interview!**  
- Find out **who will be interviewing** you and what they do.  
- Understand the **company’s projects and technologies**.  
- Many of my peers had a smooth technical interview because they **talked about Barclays' projects** and **related technologies**.  

This allows you to **steer the interview** in your favor. I only **partially did this**, but it makes a **huge difference**.  

💡 **If you haven’t cracked a company yet, don’t worry.**  
> _Race abhi lambi hai!_ 🏁  

**Hope this helps! 🚀**

    *   **Interview Dates:** 4th of October, 2024
    *   **Offer Date:** Results were declared on the day of the interview.

---

### 3. 💬 **Interview Rounds**

#### Round 1: Online Assessment
*   **Type:** Coding and MCQs
*   **Description:** Questions were mainly asked on DSA concepts and CS fundamentals. You weren't free to choose your own language while solving the questions - so I'd reccommend that you constantly keep in touch with multiple languages as opposed to just coding in the language that you're comfortable in.

    *   **Questions asked:**
        1.  Regular expression matching in Java
        2.  Finding the maximum value in Javascript
        3.  Creation of a template class in C++
*   **Difficulty Level:** Easy-Medium
*   **Your Experience:** Despite the questions being easy, you were tested on a variety of concepts and languages. One very effective way to gain proficiency in different programming languages are your lab assignments at PICT. Usually you are free to choose your own language to solve assignments (atleast in TE labs) and so please solve different assignments in different languages. This'll help save time in the Intern season as you wouldn't have to start any language from scratch. And, of course, please code your assignments on your own, without using generative AI. It genuinely helps you in the long run :)

#### Round 2: Technical Interview
*   **Type:** Technical + Managerial
*   **Description:** Resume-specific questions were asked. Additionally, DSA questions were also asked. 

*   **Your Experience:** Before this round, please make sure you know every single thing on your CV. Also make sure that you can explain all of it in an easy-to-understand way. 
* Also solve a lot of DSA problems and be consistent with your practise. Also give a lot of contests and take rating very seriously (so that you have some skin in the game), to simulate the stressful interview and OA environment.
* Also since the company wanted interns for a cloud-focused role, having some knowledge in the field of cloud computing would definitely be advantageous. 
#### Round 3: HR Round

* The interviewer gave me a few scenarios and asked me what I would do in those situations. Questions were such that they tested whether you could work in a team. Also there was a very interesting question about what's more important - modern software or legacy software.
    
---

### 4. 📊 **Overall Experience & Tips**

*   **Overall Interview Experience:** Enjoyed preparing for it and it was a wonderful experience.
*   **What to prepare?**  DSA, OOP, DBMS, OS, Cloud computing
*   **Tips for Aspirants:** Remember, interviews aren't Q&A sessions, they are more like discussions. So ask a lot of questions. Ask for clarifications where necessary and if you are stuck on a question, ask the interviewer for a hint. 
*   **Verdict:** Selected

## Hi folks, Myself Srujan Mukund sharing my On-Campus SWE Interview Experience of Arista Networks.👇 
---
Arista Networks is a ‘dream category’ company which visits Pune Institute of Computer Technology for SWE role. This year there was tight criteria of 9 CGPA and was visiting the campus after 2 years so every one equally exicted and ready to crack the seat.

**Round 1: Online Assessment**

The test consisted of MCQs related to Core Subjects and 3 Coding Questions. MCQs were also having negative marking scheme.

    Coding question 1: Maximum Subarray Sum.
    Coding question 2: Graph question-BFS (delayed flights). consist of flight’s timing and delayed flights array and have to return no of corresponding delayed flights.
    Coding question 3:DP array question.
I was able to solve 1 complete (2nd) whereas the other 2 were partially solved. Among 120 candidates 19 Candidate were shortlisted for the Interviews where mostly the total score was considered. Interviews were scheduled in-person at our campus.

**Round 2: Technical Interview I (1.5 hrs)**

This round for all candidates were parallelly scheduled and every one of us has to carry laptops for the round they were asking us to write the code over some collaborative platform. The round started with quick introduction firstly my interviewer introduced himself and then I went for my turn and given him a short summary about my profile. First question he asked me was, he showed me a C code Snippet and asked the output it was related to the call by reference and call by value. Then there where 2 Coding question among which 1 was common for all the candidates.

    Question 1(Common): Largest BST in Binary Tree — he wanted me to write the code from scratch. I solved the problem on paper first as i have not solved it before and explained the approach first and then written the code. He tested the code by giving different test cases and I had to optimize and reverify it.
    Question 2: Adding two Numbers which are in Linked List form — I had done it before so explained him and started coding it.
I was able to solve both of them and then he asked some OS question- What is mutex, semaphore, difference between mutex and semaphore. Some Memory Allocation question in C, Call by reference, Pointers in C. Discussion ended up by question on my Summer Internship, followed by questions from my side.

**Round 3: Technical Interview II (1 hr)**

This round was Virtual round immediately after the1st one, some of the candidates were eliminated from round 1.This round started with my introduction and then interviewer wanted me to go through my Resume and explain him my projects. He noted some points and then asked me how would i implement those in my projects. Some discussion on which data structure to use, how would i retrieve the required information from the same. Also asked about the background of the project its team and distribution. Most of the time of this round was project discussion.

Then some OS question like what is Virtual memory, Pages, difference between 32 bit and 64 bit OS, what is Physical address space. Some discussion over my semester results.

**Round 4: Technical + Managerial (45-50 min)**

This round was also scheduled virtually. After giving our intros he asked me about my internship experience and was bit interested in the work i have done there. I explained him the what technology I have worked on and what was the potential impact of our project. Then he asked me about Databases and as I had mentioned Mysql and MongoDb in my resume, he asked me to list down various queries for both and highlight some similarities and differences. One question he asked was if I have to retrieve from large number of records what could be done for database optimization for faster retrieval. I was firstly no able to think other than partitioning the large data into parts. He was not completely convinced by the answer and after some time i told him that indexing is the optimal solution, which he was expecting me to answer and then some question on What is index, index table, can we have index on 2 or more attribute and what happed to the speed of retrieval if index are added for every col….

Then asked about my carrier goals also asked me about do i have interest for System Software and its working. Explained me some working and changes made from the start of the organization.

**Round 5: HR(30 min)**

This Round was last round and 5 candidates were selected for this round. Here HR asked me about my background, hometown, why do I wanted to join arista networks, hobbies and how was the overall experience during entire interview process. Some discussion over compensation they were offering, any prior offer which i was holding and normal HR type questions.

**Conclusion✅️**

At the end after all the process and some playful prank they announced the result and 5 Candidates including me were selected.

### Round 1: Online Assessment (1hr)

The test consisted of MCQs related to aptitude for 15 min and 2 Coding Questions for 45 min.

    Coding question 1: basic array sorting question in increasing and decreasing order on given k.
    Coding question 2: sort array where even number should come after odd numbers.
The test was easy-medium level, the factor was the time and the total score so along with the coding question, mcq score was important.

23 students were shortlisted for Virtual interview rounds.

---
### Round 2: Technical Interview I (1hr)

Interview were held virtually. The Interview Started with a quick introduction and the interviewer told me that he’ll be judging me on DSA and DBMS. He wanted me to write the code on paper and send it to him on the chat section and then we’ll have a discussion.

     Question 1: Find length of longest consecutive substring of 1s and 0s in a very very large binary string. I wrote the code using maximum count variable and len variable, explained to him the approach and discussed the edge case of substring at the end.
     Question 2: This was a DBMS question where they gave me the data and scenario and asked me to create the Sql Table and Relation. Further asked me to retrieve information from the table as he wanted. Discussion on topics like normalization, joins happened.

The round ended with some discussion on projects and asked do I have any questions for him.I asked some questions about the company and his role.

---

### Round 3: Technical Interview II (2.5–3 hr)

This round was scheduled in the evening and was the lengthiest interview I have given. Only few interviews were this much lengthy not all 3rd rounds. The interviewer was interested in DSA concepts and asked me to share a leetcode profile and some discussion over my summer internship about the work and tasks performed there. He Started asking me questions one by one and wanted me to share screen and write code on an IDE/online compiler. I chose C++, the question level was easy medium, he was interested in how i code the solution and what approach did i used.

Questions were- first n prime numbers, binary search, merge sort algo, Linked list creation, deletion, update the node, reverse a number, decimal to binary number. Sometimes asked me both in a recursive and interactive way. After each code he used to check the edge case too. These were fundamental questions he wanted to check the approach and coding skills.

The last question was, he gave me 2 types of records consisting of some id and description and asked me could you suggest how you could store this and then we have to perform some operation. He wanted file handling but I was not comfortable with that so used normal class, objects and data structures. This question was tricky one as he was not expecting solution with any bound in time or space complexity. A lot more discussion on this question was done and at the end he told me the optimal way he thought of.

After this round 10–12 were selected for the next round

---

### Round 4: Coding test(90 min)

In this round we got a problem statement and have to code it and send it back to them without compiling as it should be the first draft of your code. Main focus was on the Modularity and Code Optimization, and this code was reviewed by the next interviewer on this basis the last round was held.

---

### Round 5: HR/Managerial(30 min)

In this round some discussion over the submitted code and some refinements were told by him. Interviewer was expecting out of the box thinking. And normal Hr question, strengths, improvements and hobbies and discussion about the company culture and work. He asked me about hobbies and later we went on some discussion over cricket and favorite player.

---

### Conclusion✅️✅️:

I got selected along with 7 more candidates for SDE and 8 for QA roles. Main thing which could help in the entire rounds were the base fundamentals and key concepts of what you have added to your profile. Interviewer was totally interested in coding approach and logic proposed by us.",https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKOTlmJ8l5DqsTC1i5agzUVurhTt5HApTgvoW7Jwfy4H90pd3Mm=s96-c,Wed Feb 19 2025 14:53:33 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)

## To the developers of this website

This is a good initiative taken up by PICT students. Interview experiences *can* help to some extent in campus placements. Experiences found on the internet are either too old (pre-COVID era) or not relevant to the role/company/campus.

Keep the good work up 👍🏻

## **Application Process**
In November 2022, I applied for the **Software Development Engineer** role on the Bloomberg career portal for multiple locations. In December, I received an email saying that I was shortlisted for the interview at **Bloomberg Frankfurt** and scheduled my interview for **January 20, 2023**.

However, Bloomberg also visited my college for an **on-campus recruitment drive for the Pune location** on **January 17, 2023**, for a full-time role. This gave me another opportunity to apply. I'm excited to share my experience to help anyone preparing for an interview at Bloomberg!

## **Overview**
The Bloomberg recruitment process followed these steps:
1. **Screening test** (coding + MCQs)
2. **DSA interview** (same day as the test)
3. **System Design interview** (after a week)
4. **Managerial interview** (final round)
5. **Final selection** ✅



## **Round 1: Screening Test**
**Platform:** HackerRank  
**Mode:** Offline (College labs)  
**Time:** 1.5 hours  
**Difficulty:** Medium—Hard 🟠  

Since I was already preparing for the Frankfurt interview, I was well-prepared for the screening test. It consisted of:
- **4 coding questions** (Two worth 50 marks, two worth 75 marks)
- **21 MCQs** (Each worth 5 marks)  

I solved:
- 1 question (75 marks) completely ✅
- 2 questions (50 marks each) completely ✅
- 1 question (75 marks) partially (4/13 test cases)  
- A good number of MCQs ✅

**Topics covered:**
- **MCQs:** Data Structures, Algorithms, OS, DBMS, System Design (Load Balancers, Decoupling of services)
- **Coding questions:** Arrays, Strings, Recursion, Dynamic Programming, Sorting, Greedy Algorithms  

**Result:** 25 students were shortlisted from 300 applicants.  



## **Round 2: DSA Interview**
**Platform:** HackerRank Code Pair  
**Mode:** Offline (College)  
**Time:** 1 hour  
**Difficulty:** Medium 🟠  

My interviewer was a **Team Lead at Bloomberg Pune** with 18+ years of experience in banks and hedge funds. After introductions, we moved to the coding question. 

### **Coding Question**
- **Leetcode Medium** level.
- **Divided into two parts**:
  - Used **unordered map + unordered set** for part 1.
  - Used **unordered map + priority queue** for part 2.

After solving, we discussed **hashmap internal workings** and **collision resolution mechanisms**. There were also a few **resume-based questions**. 

### **Tips for DSA Round:**
- Keep your concepts **crystal clear**.
- **Think out loud** and explain your approach.
- **Don’t jump straight to coding**—ask for clarifications.
- Cover **edge cases**.
- **Be flexible** in your approach.

### **Resources for DSA:**
- **Striver’s YouTube Channel** (Highly recommend his **Recursion & DP** series)
- **GeeksForGeeks & Leetcode** (Practice questions)  

**Result:** 11 students shortlisted for the next round.  



## **Round 3: System Design Interview**
**Platform:** HackerRank Code Pair Whiteboard  
**Mode:** Offline (Bloomberg Pune Office)  
**Time:** 1 hour  
**Difficulty:** Medium—Hard 🔴  

After a week, I had my **System Design round** with a panel of **two interviewers** (one offline, one online). The second interviewer was a **Team Lead at Bloomberg Pune** who previously worked in **Bloomberg New York**.

### **System Design Question**
- Not a standard question like **Instagram or a food delivery app**.
- Asked to design a **high-level system** based on **three components** and a **given database structure**.

I designed a **scalable system**, but I felt the interviewers weren’t fully satisfied. Before the interview ended, I asked a few **questions about Bloomberg’s work culture**.

### **Tips for System Design:**
- **Ask questions first**—don’t jump into designing immediately.
- **Keep the interview interactive** (treat it as a discussion).
- **Be flexible**—don’t try to force-fit a design pattern.
- Justify every component/service you add.

### **Resources for System Design:**

rohin-bhat-experience-at-Credit-Suisse-intern-2023-ppssss,Rohin Bhat,bhatrohin003@gmail.com,Internship,Credit Suisse,CS,2023,"## My Internship Recruitment Experience at Credit Suisse

So it’s been around two months since I interviewed for **Credit Suisse**, a global Investment bank headquartered in Zürich, Switzerland, for the role of **Technology Intern**. I have decided to write about my overall experience throughout the whole recruitment procedure.

### Overview
In a nutshell, the procedure for the recruitment looked something like this:

- As it was an on-campus recruitment drive, I submitted my resume and a few other details.
- After the resume filtering, I received the online test link.
- After a couple of days, I got shortlisted for the interviews.
- After two interviews, I was able to bag the internship.

So let’s get started with the whole internship recruitment experience!

### Round One: The Online Test
Clearing the **Online Test** was a huge challenge for me as I was pretty new to **Competitive Programming**. The test was conducted on **HackerEarth**. The pattern was:

- **2 MCQ questions** (6 marks each)
- **3 Programming questions** (Two 50 marks questions and One 100 marks question)

The MCQ questions were completely random. The questions I received were based on **Microsoft SQL Server** and **Hadoop Hive**, while others received questions based on **XML, PostgreSQL, C#, Java, Python**, and other topics. I did not know the answer to either of the questions, so I just guessed them, as answering each question was mandatory.

The three programming questions were as follows *(Not the exact questions, framed according to my memory and rough work):*

#### **Max Divisor Tree (50 M)**
Given a tree with a root node **N**, which has a property that the children of any node are one of the factors of that node (except **1** and the number itself). What is the maximum height of the tree?

✅ I solved this question, passing **all 10 test cases**.

#### **The Abandoned City (50 M)**
You are in an abandoned city, and the only way to get out is by paying some coins. To collect these coins, you need to traverse some of the **N** houses. Every **ith** house has a maximum of **Ai** coins. You can start traversing from any house but you can only go in **one direction** (left or right). To get out of the city, you need to pay **K coins**. Find the minimum number of houses you need to visit to get out of the city (**-1** if it is not possible to get out).

✅ I solved this question **partially**, passing **6/10 test cases**.

#### **Number of Ones (100 M)**
You are given a binary string with **3 ones** and **2 zeroes**. After an operation, it has **4 ones** and **3 zeroes**. The operations follow the pattern:

- **No. of 1s in ith string** = No. of 1s in (i-1)th string + **3** × No. of 0s in (i-2)th string.
- **No. of 0s in ith string** = **2** × No. of 0s in (i-1)th string + **2** × No. of 1s in (i-2)th string.

Given **N**, find the number of ones in the **Nth string**. Return the answer modulo **10⁹ + 7**.

✅ I solved this question **partially**, passing **4/10 test cases**.

The overall difficulty of the **MCQs** was **Hard**, and that of the **Programming questions** was **Intermediate**.

✅ **32 students** were selected for the second round, and I was one of them.

### Round Two: The Technical Interview
This interview was supposed to be a **Technical Interview**, and I was expecting a lot of questions about **Data Structures and Algorithms**. However, it was more like a **techno-HR round** for me.

- **Platform:** Zoom  
- **Time:** 35-40 mins

We were made to wait in the **lobby** till our turn. Then we were sent into a **breakout room** from where we were sent to the rooms for the interview. There were **2 interviewers** for me. The first one asked **tech-oriented questions**, while the other asked **situation-based questions**. Both the interviewers were **super friendly**.

#### **First Interviewer:**

- **Can you explain Flutter to me?**  
  Explained Flutter and Dart in short.
- **Is Dart/Flutter similar to Kotlin?**  
  Explained how Dart has features from various languages like **JavaScript and Java**.
- **Questions related to my project (Fast n’ Fresh)**  
  Discussed responsibilities and tech stack.
- **Asked about my internships and team sizes.**
- **Asked about Agile methodology.**  
  I had no idea but explained my workflow at previous internships.
- **Asked about DBMS.**  
  Mentioned I had it in my current semester and preferred practicals over theory.
- **What is metadata?**  
  Guessed it as **data about data** in a database.
- **What data structures are you comfortable with?**  
  Mentioned **arrays, queue, stack, linked lists**, but not **trees and graphs**.

#### **Second Interviewer:**

- **Have you worked with unknown teammates before?**
- **How would you handle a team where members ask too many doubts?**
- **Would you prefer working with people from different cultures or familiar people?**
- **Would working with a disabled colleague affect the project?**
- **If a goof-up happened from your side, and the team was ready to share the blame, would you go with the team or take responsibility?**

✅ **16 students were selected for the internship, and I was one of them.**

### Conclusion
#### **A few tips if you are appearing for the interview:**

- ✅ **Be confident** while answering questions.
- ✅ **Review every detail** in your resume/portfolio.
- ✅ **Be honest** and say **NO** if you don’t know something.
- ✅ **Pay attention** during the **Pre-Placement Talks**.
- ✅ **Be patient!** You might have to wait for long hours in the interview process.

## **3. Interview Rounds**

### **Round 1: Online Assessment**
- **Type:** Coding and MCQs  
- **Description:** The test focused on DSA concepts and core computer science topics. One major challenge was that you were not allowed to pick a preferred programming language. This highlights the importance of being proficient in multiple languages rather than sticking to just one.

#### **Questions Asked:**
- Regular expression matching in Java
- Finding the maximum value in Javascript
- Creation of a template class in C++

#### **Your Experience:**
Although the difficulty level of the questions was moderate, the assessment tested knowledge across various topics and languages. A great way to build multi-language proficiency is by leveraging lab assignments at PICT. Since TE labs generally allow language choice, it's beneficial to solve assignments in different languages.This approach will be a time-saver during internship season as you won't have to learn new languages from scratch. Most importantly, code your assignments by yourself instead of relying on generative AI—this will provide long-term benefits.

### **Round 2: Technical Interview**
- **Type:** Technical + Managerial  
- **Description:** This round involved in-depth questions based on the resume, as well as DSA problems.

#### **Your Experience:**
Before the interview, thoroughly review every detail on your resume. Ensure you can explain all points in a clear and structured manner.

Additionally, consistent DSA practice is key. Participating in competitive programming contests helps simulate high-pressure environments similar to OAs and interviews. Since the company was looking for interns for cloud-related roles, having a basic understanding of cloud computing concepts would be beneficial.

Some questions asked were:
- Questions on projects mentioned in the resume
- Four pillars of OOP
- How will you find the quotient and reminder of division without using multiplication and division operations.
- Puzzle – If you have a string with an uneven burning rate that fully burns in one hour, how will you determine when 30 minutes have passed? Similarly, how can you measure 45 minutes using two such strings?

Always remember while giving answers explain each and everything in detail and give answers if you are damn sure about it. Before writing the code in interview discuss approach first, and while writing the code discuss with the interviewer as well and give him idea of what you are doing.

**Application Process**

In **July,** I applied for the Software Engineering (SWE) internship **Off-campus** through the **Microsoft Careers** portal. 

**Online Assessment (OA) – September 5th**

After **resume shortlisting**, I received the invitation for an online assessment. The OA had 2 questions — Leetcode medium to hard — and I managed to solve both the questions. 

**Interview Shortlisting – October 11th**

I was thrilled to receive an email confirming that I had been selected for the interview round. The interview was scheduled for **October 21st**, and I had about 10 days to prepare intensively.

**Technical Interviews – October 21st**

Microsoft conducted two technical interviews on the same day, both focused on coding and problem-solving. :

**Technical Round 1 (9:00 AM - 9:45 AM)**

The interviewer started with a brief introduction and asked about my projects and previous experience.

I was given **1 DSA problem** of medium-hard difficulty.

This problem was based on trees. I came up with a **brute-force** approach and explained it to the interviewer. Then she asked me to optimize it and code it out on a platform called codility.

Then, we had some follow-up questions like the **edge cases** and  **time complexity**.

After this, there were a few questions on **OOPS** and **DBMS**.

**Technical Round 2 (10:00 AM - 11:00 AM)**

After 10 mins of my round 1, I received a selection email for round 2. This round also began with an introduction and a discussion on my resume.

I was asked a  **medium to hard level** recursion and string-based DSA question. The interviewer focused on my thought process, efficiency, and edge cases.I came up with **an Optimal** approach and explained it to the interviewer Then he asked me to  code it out and also **dry run** it.
Towards the end, we discussed **Operating Systems** and **DBMS.**

Both interviewers were friendly and encouraged me. It was important to explain my thought process and write clean, efficient code.

**Final Result – Selected!**

The next day **(22nd October),** I received the confirmation that I had been **selected** for the Microsoft SWE Internship! .

**Key Takeaways**

pratik-patils-experience-at-phonepe-intern-2025-UlSALJ,Pratik Patil,pratikpatilmudalp3@gmail.com,Intern,PhonePe,CS,2025,"**PhonePe Interview Experience**

Round 1:
The first round was entirely focused on data structures and algorithms. Three questions were asked during this round, mostly from dynamic programming, trees, and graphs. The difficulty level of the questions ranged from medium to hard.
Question 1: You are given a tree where each node has a value associated with it. You can pick any node, and the value corresponding to that node will be added to your score. However, once a node is selected, you cannot pick its direct children. Your task is to maximize the score.
My Approach: I explained a solution using tree-based dynamic programming concepts. The solution was based on the ""pick or don't pick"" strategy. I maintained a Boolean variable to decide whether to take the current node or not. Depending on the decision made for the current node, the next process was simulated. Then, I memorized the solution using a DP table of size N*2.
Question 2: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock IV
My Approach: I explained the solution using a recursive function with parameters like index, transactions used, and a Boolean parameter to indicate whether we should buy or sell. For buying, I added the negative of the price, and for selling, I added the actual price. I memoized the solution using a DP table of size N*K*2, and then I explained an iterative solution with optimal space complexity using just PREV and CURR, similar to Striver's approach.
Question 3: Given a binary tree, find the k-th ancestor of any node and report -1 if the ancestor is not present.
My Approach: I explained the solution using binary lifting. In binary lifting, we store the 2^i-th parent for all the nodes. I started by finding the 2^0 th parent for each node using DFS, and then calculated the2^(i+1)-th parent using the 2^i-th parent. This approach is better for query-based problems.
The interviewer was impressed since I provided optimal solutions and used concepts like binary lifting to solve the problem. We then had a discussion about PhonePe and the importance of problem-solving for software engineer.

Round 2:
This round also focused on data structures and algorithms, and the problems asked were more challenging than those in the first round.
The first question was about Disjoint Set Union (DSU). The problem involved deleting edges, but DSU is typically used to add edges. To solve this, the offline queries technique was required. By starting the queries from the last one, deleting edges could be treated as adding them, since it’s done in reverse order. This approach allowed for the correct handling of edge removals using the Disjoint Set Union.
The second problem was based on geometry. The task was to find the maximum slope between points and connect those points. The solution involved calculating and comparing the slopes to determine the maximum one.
I was able to solve the second problem successfully. For the first problem, I shared my idea of using the Disjoint Set Union as part of the solution, even though I didn’t fully solve it.

Round 3:
During this interview, the focus was on my internship at TraceLink Inc., where I worked for two months. The interviewer started by asking me to describe my overall experience. I talked about the company, the projects I worked on, and the new skills I gained.
After that, we discussed my specific tasks in detail. The interviewer wanted to know how I managed the data used to create Grafana dashboards. I explained how I collected the data, sent it to Grafana, and ensured that everything worked smoothly. He was particularly interested in how I avoided race conditions when sending data to the Prometheus server. I explained that I used proper synchronization methods to make sure data was handled correctly and that no conflicts occurred.
Next, we talked about GraphQL. The interviewer asked me to explain what it is and why it’s used. I described GraphQL as a tool that helps request exactly the data needed from an API, making it more efficient as it solves the problem of over fetching and under fetching. 
We then moved on to HTTP protocols. The interviewer asked about the format of HTTP requests and responses. I explained that an HTTP request includes a method, headers, and a body, while the response includes a status code, headers, and sometimes a body. I also talked about common HTTP status codes like 200 (OK), 404 (Not Found), and 500 (Internal Server Error), explaining what each one means.
The conversation then shifted to the branching system we used during my internship. I explained how we used Git to manage our code, created separate branches for new features, and merged them after reviewing the changes. The interviewer was interested in how I handled conflicts during this process. I described how I communicated with team members to resolve any issues, carefully reviewed the changes, and made sure everything worked properly after merging.
Finally, we discussed the interviewer’s work. He shared details about his projects and the challenges he faced, which gave me a better understanding of the work environment and how my experiences compared to his.

VERDICT: Selected

### Round 2: Technical Interview

The technical interview was conducted by two interviewers from ION Trading. We started with a brief introduction about myself, as prompted by the interviewers after they reviewed my resume.

**1\. LRU Cache Design:** One of the interviewers began by explaining the concept of a cache. Although I was familiar with caching, I listened carefully as he detailed it. He then gave me a problem involving the Least Recently Used (LRU) cache, specifying that the `get` and `insert` operations must be performed in O(1) time, while maintaining the LRU property.

Initially, I thought about using a priority queue, but as I worked through the problem, I recalled the use of a doubly linked list. The interviewer hinted at optimizing retrieval time, suggesting the use of a hash map. I proposed using a hash map to maintain addresses, combined with a doubly linked list for efficient management. This approach met the O(1) requirement, and I successfully explained the pseudocode.

**2\. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts:** The interviewers then shifted to questions about OOP concepts. They asked why OOP is important, and we discussed key principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism real life use.

**3\. System Design (OOP focused): Uber Taxi Management System:** Next, they asked me to design a class-based architecture for an Uber-like taxi management system. I outlined my approach, focusing on how classes would interact to manage drivers, riders, rides, and payments. The interviewers appreciated my design and the thought process behind it.

**4\. Programming Challenge: Zigzag Level Order Traversal:** We returned to programming questions, and I was asked to implement a level order traversal of a binary tree. While I was writing the code, they asked me to modify it to perform a zigzag (spiral) traversal. I successfully made the adjustments to the code to handle zigzag traversal.  
(This much I can recall)

### Round 3: Case Study

[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/360572179\_Traditional\_vs\_Online\_Education](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/360572179_Traditional_vs_Online_Education)  
In this round, the interviewer opened a PDF document on his laptop and asked me to read a paragraph related to online and traditional education. After reading, he asked me a series of questions to gauge my analytical thinking and perspective on the topic.

**1\. What is better: online education or traditional education?**  
**My Answer:** I explained that it depends on the situation. For children aged 5-16, traditional education is generally better as it supports overall growth, including social and physical development. For those aged 16 and above, both online and traditional education have their merits. Online education can be more flexible, time-saving, and offer a better understanding through interactive content.

**2\. Why not online education for kids?**  
**My Answer:** I mentioned concerns such as health issues (like eye strain), growth problems due to reduced physical activity, potential for addiction to screens, and the lack of social interaction that can lead to feelings of isolation.

**3\. Will online education overtake traditional education?**  
**My Response:** I believe online education will not completely replace traditional education, but it will certainly impact and complement it. The two can coexist, each serving different needs and preferences.

**4\. If various online education platforms like Byju’s are failing or facing losses, what would you do as the CEO or management?**  
**My Response:** I suggested opening offline centers in collaboration with popular local teachers to create a hybrid learning model. This would combine the strengths of both online and offline education. Additionally, I would focus on reducing unnecessary spending and optimizing resource allocation to improve financial stability.

**Conclusion:**  
In conclusion, I believe both online and traditional education have their places. The best approach may be a blended model that leverages the advantages of both to meet diverse learning needs.

### Round 4: Stakeholder

This round was conducted with the ION Pune head. The session started with a brief introduction, followed by some personal questions.

**1\. Introduction and Family Background:**  
The interviewer asked me to introduce myself and inquired about my family background, showing interest in my personal life.

**2\. Managing Multiple Responsibilities:**  
After going through my resume, he seemed impressed and asked how I managed to handle multiple responsibilities, including academics, internships, and personal projects. I shared my approach to time management, prioritization, and staying organized.

**3\. Personal Traits:**  
He asked an insightful question: ""What bad or false point would your friends tell me about you if I asked them?"" This was a reflective moment, and I acknowledged areas where I might have received constructive criticism from friends, emphasizing my willingness to improve.

**4\. Internship Experience:**  
We discussed my internship experiences. I explained the tasks I worked on during my internships, highlighting key projects and the skills I acquired.

**5\. Projects Overview:**  
The conversation then moved to my personal projects. I discussed various projects, focusing on the **Messwala app**, detailing its purpose, technology stack, and the challenges faced during development.

**6\. Current Work and Interests:**  
I shared information about what I am currently working on, including the skills and technologies I am focusing on to further develop my expertise.

**7\. Interest in ION Trading:**  
The interviewer asked why I was interested in working at ION Trading. I discussed my enthusiasm for the finance and trading sector, my desire to contribute to innovative projects, and how ION's values align with my career goals.

**Conclusion:**  
The interaction was enjoyable and more conversational, resembling an HR interview but with detailed discussions about my background and aspirations. The interview lasted around 20 minutes and left a positive impression.

anjali-rambhads-experience-at-mastercard-intern-2026-GmMcVe,Anjali Rambhad,anjalirambhad28@gmail.com,Intern,Mastercard,CS,2026,"**From My First Hackathon to an Internship at Mastercard: My Journey Through the Code for Change Hackathon**

When I signed up for the Code for Change Hackathon last year, I had no idea it would lead to an internship at Mastercard. What made it even more special? It was my very first hackathon. I was extremely excited—and yes, a little nervous. But I didn’t want to go in unprepared, so I began my preparations a week in advance. Looking back, that decision made all the difference.

**The First Hurdle: DSA Round**

Before the actual hackathon began, we had a DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms) round with two medium-level questions—one based on trees and the other on graphs. Thankfully, I was able to solve both. Although the second problem had a couple of tricky test cases I couldn’t pass, I managed to crack most of them.

Here’s what I learned: Consistency in DSA is non-negotiable. I’m not a DSA expert, and I still struggle with many LeetCode problems. But I try to solve 1–2 questions every day. You can't master DSA in a week or even a month—it’s a long-term game. Keep at it, and you'll see the benefits.

**Preparing for the Hackathon**

One of the most common mistakes participants make is going into hackathons unprepared. No matter how proficient you are in development, AI/ML, or any other domain, take some time to revise your core concepts. Whether it's Java, React, Node.js, or machine learning—make sure you understand the foundations.

Our hackathon started early—at 6 AM—and we made sure to reach before time. Since all my teammates were from different colleges, we were meeting for the first time. Most of them were shy and introverted. That’s when it hit me: a hackathon is a team effort. It doesn't matter how skilled you are—unless you work with your team, you won’t be able to perform your best.

**Breaking the Ice: Teamwork First**

One of the first things I focused on was breaking the ice. I encouraged everyone to talk openly and share their ideas. Creating a comfortable and collaborative environment is crucial because planning is the most important phase of any hackathon. Clear communication ensures everyone is on the same page.

Don’t jump into coding right away. Instead, spend time deciding the tech stack, system architecture, and most importantly, clarifying each member's role. Equal involvement and early planning can save hours of confusion later on.

**Building + Presenting = Winning**

Here’s a reality check: What you make and what you present can be completely different. In our case, the backend wasn’t functioning perfectly, but we didn’t let that pull us down. We focused on building a clean and well-structured frontend, ensuring the UI/UX was polished and intuitive.

Adding small, out-of-the-box features can really impress the judges. Focus on the problem statement, but don’t hesitate to go a step further.

And remember—if there’s a mentor or leader assigned to your group, listen to their suggestions and try to implement them. They often have a broader perspective and can guide you in the right direction.

Lastly, take initiatives wherever you can. Whether it’s leading discussions, designing mockups, or presenting the final pitch—show ownership. It not only helps the team but also leaves a strong impression on mentors and judges alike.


**Key Takeaways:**

1. Participate in as many hackathons as possible. They help you think on your feet and improve logical and critical thinking.
2. Consistency is key in DSA. Even one question a day makes a difference.
3. Hackathons are team events. You can’t win alone—collaboration is the real superpower.
4. What you present matters as much as what you build. Make your demo count.
5. Early and clear communication is essential to avoid confusion later.
6. Take initiative and be proactive. It reflects both leadership and enthusiasm.

**Result**: Runner-up team✅

**Rounds**: Online Assessment + Offline Hackathon at Mastercard Pune office

Hello readers, Harsha this side. I am a 3rd-year undergrad pursuing Information Technology from Pune Institute Of Computer Technology (PICT). I had the opportunity to participate in the Mastercard < Code For Change> Hackathon 2024. Here’s a glimpse of my experience.


**About the Hackathon: How Did I Learn About the Opportunity?**

Mastercard introduced its hackathon-based internship hiring process in 2024. This hackathon was specifically for the top 5 colleges from Pune, PICT being one of them. This hackathon had its primary aim to provide NGOs with technical solutions.
In mid-July 2024 my college's training and placement department announced the registrations for the event.

**Eligibility Criteria:**

> Minimum 7.5 GPA aggregate in university

> At least 75% in both 10th and 12th boards.

> No active backlogs.

**Application Portal:**

I applied through Mastercard’s official Application Portal. After submitting my application, I received a link to take a coding test on HirePro.

>**Pro tip**: Submit a resume with strong projects, volunteering, or internship experiences as it plays a key role in the shortlisting process

**Online Assessment:**

**Difficulty: Medium🟡**

The coding test consisted of 2 questions to be solved within an hour.

• The first question was puzzle-related. I spent a considerable amount of time trying to optimize my solution but ultimately submitted a brute-force approach.

• The second question was related to trees, which I couldn’t completely solve.

To my surprise, I was shortlisted for the offline hackathon :D


**Pre-hackathon:**

Before the offline hackathon, all the shortlisted participants were divided into teams of 8 and allocated a mentor from the Mastercard team. A Mentor Connect session was arranged for all the teams on 14th August (also my birthday :D) to help us get to know our team better, which would eventually help us develop an optimal solution on hackathon day. The problem statements were to be released on the day of the hackathon itself. My team members were really fun and engaging. We organized various online team meetings and discussed the tech stacks that all of us were familiar with. We also smartly distributed our roles according to our interests and expertise. Qualities such as communication skills, market research and leadership were also taken into consideration.

**D-day: The Offline Hackathon**

All the participants were asked to report to the Mastercard Pune office at 7 am on 23rd August 2024. The problem statements were released at 9:00 am and were allocated on a random basis. These were real-life problems given by NGOs. We were handed over a document where the main problem came with multiple sub-problems specifying categories (high, medium, and low priority), and technologies that were to be addressed. The most important factor was how effectively we were able to solve the problem.
During the first 1.5 hours, my team thoroughly brainstormed solutions to address the problem. We divided all of our ideas into a list of must-haves, should-haves, could-haves, and won’t-haves, considering we were time-bound. I made sure to communicate with other teammates & efficiently build the project.
I also made sure to showcase and discuss my work with my mentor as they’d be making the decision to select me. We were to submit our Github repository link along with our idea-pitch presentation before 16:45.
Throughout the day, Mastercard ensured we were well-fed with breakfast, lunch, snacks, and dinner. (Their cupcakes were divine!)


**Post-hackathon:**
The presentations began at 6 am. I, along with one of my teammates, took the lead in presenting during the event. The presentation is of utmost importance as you showcase your solutions to the senior members including VPs of Mastercard. There were 22 teams in total. All the presentations concluded by 21:30.

**Results:**

Teams were asked to have their dinner. Post-dinner, all the participants were eagerly waiting for the results. Mastercard really tested our patience as it was almost 23:00 and results were yet not announced. At 11:30 pm, we saw the judges approaching the presentation hall, and the room fell silent. When I heard, “And the runner-up team is Team 3!” I got literal goosebumps. It was an exhilarating moment for my team.

**Final Thoughts:**

It was an amazing experience overall. Truly grateful to the team Mastercard for providing me with such an amazing opportunity.


That’s all about my experience. Thank you for reading, I hope it was insightful. Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn for any questions or thoughts.
Good luck with your journey!
